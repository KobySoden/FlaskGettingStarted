Flask will look for templates in the templates folder. So if your application is a module, this folder is next to that module, if it’s a package it’s actually inside your package:

Inside templates you also have access to the config, request, session and g 1 objects as well as the url_for() and get_flashed_messages() functions.

Templates are especially useful if inheritance is used. If you want to know how that works, see Template Inheritance. Basically template inheritance makes it possible to keep certain elements on each page (like header, navigation and footer).
